# Tomato Timer

My implementation tomato timer on C Language. This implementation is made for terminals and for the program uses the library "ncurses.h". It works very simply, 25 minutes of work and 5 minutes of rest, and so on in a cycle.

## Install

To run it, you must install ```cmake```.

```
sudo apt install cmake
```

## Run

A ready-to-use assembly ```CMakeLists``` has already been written to start.

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
./main
```
